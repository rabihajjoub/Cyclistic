# Cyclistic
its a case study for a google data analytics certification


The director of marketing of Cyclistic, Lily Moreno, believes that the companyâ€™s future growth depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Hence, the marketing analyst team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the analytics team could be able to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

Three questions will guide the future marketing campaign:

1.How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

2.Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

3.How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

I have been assigned by Moreno the first question.
